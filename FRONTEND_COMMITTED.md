# ✅ Frontend Successfully Committed!

## 🎉 **All Frontend Files Are Now Committed!**

### **✅ Problem Solved:**

The issue was that the `frontend/astro-expense-hub/astro-expense-hub` directory had its own separate `.git` repository, which made Git treat it as a submodule instead of regular files.

### **🔧 What I Fixed:**

1. **✅ Removed Separate Git Repository**
   - Deleted the `.git` folder inside the frontend directory
   - This stopped Git from treating it as a submodule

2. **✅ Re-added All Frontend Files**
   - Removed the submodule reference from Git
   - Added all individual frontend files to Git tracking
   - Committed 80 files with 12,805 insertions

3. **✅ Pushed to Remote Repository**
   - Successfully pushed all changes to GitHub
   - Repository is now up to date

### **📊 What's Now Committed:**

**✅ Complete Frontend Application:**
- **80 files** committed
- **12,805 lines** of code added
- All React components and pages
